# Configuration

The following configuration options must be set inside the fladle block. See the [sample configuration](/fladle/configuration#sample-configuration) below. There is also a [groovy sample](https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/blob/master/sample/build.gradle) and a [kotlin sample](https://github.com/runningcode/fladle/blob/master/sample-kotlin/build.gradle.kts).

### serviceAccountCredentials

!!! note ""
    `serviceAccountCredentials` is the only required field in the Fladle configuration.

The service account credential is a file which contains authentication credentials for a service account created in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
It can be created with the editor role [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/).
Instructions on how to create this account can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/continuous).
  Optionally, the serviceAccountCredentials can be set with [environment variables](https://github.com/TestArmada/flank#authenticate-with-a-service-account) but then the projectId parameter must be set.


### variant

!!! note
    `variant` must be set if using buildFlavors in order to automatically configure the debugApk and testApk.

Set the variant to automatically configure for testing. A build variant is a combination of buildFlavor and buildType.
This must also be set when testing against a non-default variant.
For example: 'debug' or 'freeDebug'.
Put this inside your Fladle block.

=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    variant = "freeDebug"
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    variant.set("freeDebug")
    ```

## Sample Configuration

```


### useOrchestrator
Whether or not we should use the android test orchestrator to run this tests.
Set this to true when the build.gradle file includes `testOptions.execution 'ANDROID_TEST_ORCHESTRATOR'`

### testTargets
Set multiple testTargets to be run by Flank. These are used to whitelist or blacklist test classes, test cases and test annotations.
See [Google Cloud Firebase docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firebase/test/android/run) for more information.

### devices
A list of devices to run the tests against. When list is empty, a default device will be used. Each device entry is a map.  The valid keys in the map are `model`, `version`, `orientation`, and `locale`.  When a key is not set or is null, a default value will be used.

### projectId
The projectId is a unique identifier which can be found in the project's URL: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectId>`
This is automatically discovered based on the service credential by default.

### flankVersion
Need a different Flank version? Specify it with `flankVersion`.

To use a snapshot:
=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    flankVersion = "flank_snapshot"`
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    flankVersion.set("flank_snapshot")
    ```

Need more than 50 shards? Use Flank `8.1.0`.

To use a different version:
=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    flankVersion = "{{ fladle.flank_version }}"
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    flankVersion.set("{{ fladle.flank_version }}")
    ```

### flankCoordinates
`flankCoordinates = "com.github.flank:flank"` to specify custom flank coordinates.

### debugApk
This is a string representing the path to the app's debug apk.
Supports wildcard characters.
Optional, prefer to set [variant](/configuration#variant).

=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    debugApk = project.provider { "${buildDir.toString()}/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk" }
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    debugApk.set(project.provider { "${buildDir.toString()}/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk" })
    ```

### instrumentationApk
This is a string representing the path to the app's instrumentaiton apk.
Supports wildcard characters.
Optional, prefer to set [variant](/configuration#variant).
InstrumenationApk should not be set when using [roboScript](/configuration#roboscript).

=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    debugApk = project.provider { "${buildDir.toString()}/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/*.apk" }
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    debugApk.set(project.provider { "${buildDir.toString()}/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/*.apk" })
    ```

### additionalTestApks
Paths to additional test configurations.
Order matters. A test apk is run with the nearest previous listed app apk.
For library modules, add them to the list with a `- test:` in front. For test apks which belong to an application module, add them with `  test:`.
It is not required to list an app apk here. If there is no app apk listed in additionalTestApks, the test apks are run against the [debugApk](#debugapk).

=== "Groovy"
    ```groovy
    additionalTestApks.value(project.provider { [
    "- app: ../main/app/build/output/apk/debug/app.apk",
    "  test: ../main/app/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/app-test.apk",
    "- app: ../sample/app/build/output/apk/debug/sample-app.apk",
    "  test: ../sample/app/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/sample-app-test.apk",
    "- test: ../feature/room/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/feature-room-test.apk",
    "- test: ../library/databases/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/sample-databases-test.apk"
    ]})
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    additionalTestApks.value(project.provider { listOf(
    "- app: ../main/app/build/output/apk/debug/app.apk",
    "  test: ../main/app/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/app-test.apk",
    "- app: ../sample/app/build/output/apk/debug/sample-app.apk",
    "  test: ../sample/app/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/sample-app-test.apk",
    "- test: ../feature/room/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/feature-room-test.apk",
    "- test: ../library/databases/build/output/apk/androidTest/debug/sample-databases-test.apk"
    )})
    ```
### autoGoogleLogin
Whether or not to automatically log in using a preconfigured google account. [More Info](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/firebase/test/android/run#--auto-google-login)

### environmentVariables
Environment variables are mirrored as extra options to the am instrument -e KEY1 VALUE1 â€¦ command and passed to your test runner (typically AndroidJUnitRunner). Examples
```
environmentVariables = [
    "clearPackageData": "true" // Whether or not to remove all shared state from your device's CPU and memory after each test. [More info](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner)
]
```

### testShards
Overrides the number of automatically determined test shards for Flank to use. Uses Flanks default value when not specified.

### shardTime
The amount of time tests within a shard should take.
When set to > 0, the shard count is dynamically set based on time up to the maximmum limit defined by maxTestShards
2 minutes (120) is recommended.
default: -1 (unlimited)

### repeatTests
The number of times to repeat each test. Uses Flanks default value when not specified.

### configs
Give a name to a custom flank task and configure its options. The name is appended to the end of the flank task. For example `runFlank` becomes `runFlank<name>`.

### smartFlankGcsPath
Shard Android tests by time using historical run data. The amount of shards used is set by `testShards`.

### flakyTestAttempts
The number of times to retry failed tests. Default is 0. Max is 10.

### directoriesToPull
A list of paths that will be copied from the device's storage to the designated results bucket after the test is complete. These must be absolute paths under `/sdcard` or `/data/local/tmp`.  Path names are restricted to the characters `a-zA-Z0-9_-./+`. The paths `/sdcard` and `/data` will be made available and treated as implicit path substitutions. E.g. if `/sdcard` on a particular device does not map to external storage, the system will replace it with the external storage path prefix for that device.
=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    directoriesToPull = [
      '/sdcard/tempDir1','/data/local/tmp/tempDir2'
    ]
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    directoriesToPull = listOf(
      "/sdcard/tempDir1","/data/local/tmp/tempDir2"
    )
    ```

### filesToDownload
List of regex that is matched against bucket paths (for example: `2019-01-09_00:13:06.106000_YCKl/shard_0/NexusLowRes-28-en-portrait/bugreport.txt`) for files to be downloaded after a flank run. The results are downloaded to the `APP_MODULE/build/fladle/results/` directory.
=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    filesToDownload = [
      '.*/sdcard/tempDir1/.*','.*/data/local/tmp/tempDir2/.*'
    ]
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    filesToDownload = listOf(
      ".*/sdcard/tempDir1/.*",".*/data/local/tmp/tempDir2/.*"
    )
    ```

### testTimeout
The max time test execution can run before it is cancelled (default: 15m). It does not include any time necessary to prepare and clean up the target device. The maximum possible testing time is 45m on physical devices and 60m on virtual devices. The TIMEOUT units can be h, m, or s. If no unit is given, seconds are assumed.
Examples:
* 1h   -> 1 hour
* 5m   -> 5 minutes
* 200s -> 200 seconds
* 100  -> 100 seconds

=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    testTimeout = "1h"
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    testTimeout = "1h"
    ```

### recordVideo
Enable video recording during the test. Enabled by default.

### performanceMetrics
Monitor and record performance metrics: CPU, memory, network usage, and FPS (game-loop only). Enabled by default.

### resultsBucket
The name of a Google Cloud Storage bucket where raw test results will be stored.

### keepFilePath
Keeps the full path of downloaded files from a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Required when file names are not unique. Disabled by default.

### resultsDir
The name of a unique Google Cloud Storage object within the results bucket where raw test results will be stored. The default is a timestamp with a random suffix.

### disableSharding
Disables sharding. All tests will run on the same device. Useful for parameterized tests which do not support sharding. (default: false)

### smartFlankDisableUpload
Disables smart flank JUnit XML uploading. Useful for preventing timing data from being updated. (default: false)
[What is Smart Flank?](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/docs/smart_flank.md)

### testRunnerClass
The fully-qualified Java class name of the instrumentation test runner (default: the test manifest is parsed to determine the class name).

### localResultsDir
The local directory to store the test results. Folder is DELETED before each run to ensure only artifacts from the new run are saved.

### testTargetsAlwaysRun
Always run - these tests are inserted at the beginning of every shard. Useful if you need to grant permissions or login before other tests run

!!! note ""
    The flags below are only available with Flank 20.05.0 or higher.

### runTimeout
The max time this test run can execute before it is cancelled. s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours) suffixes are acceptable, mixes like 1h45m are currently not supported (default: unlimited).
Examples:

* 20, 20s -> 20 seconds
* 30m -> 30 minutes
* 2h -> 2 hours

### ignoreFailedTests
Always return successful task completion even when there are failed tests. Useful when parsing JUnit XML to determine failure. (default: false)

### numUniformShards
Specifies the number of shards into which you want to evenly distribute test cases. The shards are run in parallel on separate devices. For example, if your test execution contains 20 test cases and you specify four shards, each shard executes five test cases. The number of shards should be less than the total number of test cases. The number of shards specified must be >= 1 and <= 50. This option cannot be used along max-test-shards and is not compatible with smart sharding ([Smart Flank](https://github.com/Flank/flank/blob/master/docs/smart_flank.md)). If you want to take benefits of smart sharding use max-test-shards instead. (default: null)

### clientDetails
A key-value map of additional details to attach to the test matrix.([clientDetails in Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/firebase/test/android/run#--client-details)) Arbitrary key-value pairs may be attached to a test matrix to provide additional context about the tests being run. When consuming the test results, such as in Cloud Functions or a CI system, these details can add additional context such as a link to the corresponding pull request. ([Access Client Details](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/extend-with-functions#access_client_details))

### otherFiles
A list of device-path: file-path pairs that indicate the device paths to push files to the device before starting tests, and the paths of files to push. Device paths must be under absolute, whitelisted paths (${EXTERNAL_STORAGE}, or ${ANDROID_DATA}/local/tmp). Source file paths may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage (gs://â€¦).

### networkProfile
The name of the network traffic profile, for example LTE, HSPA, etc, which consists of a set of parameters to emulate network conditions when running the test (default: no network shaping; see available profiles listed by the `flank test network-profiles list` command). This feature only works on physical devices.

### roboScript
The path to a Robo Script JSON file. The path may be in the local filesystem or in Google Cloud Storage using gs:// notation. You can guide the Robo test to perform specific actions by recording a Robo Script in Android Studio and then specifying this argument. Learn more at [DOCS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/robo-ux-test#scripting).

### roboDirectives
List of robo_directives that you can use to customize the behavior of Robo test. The type specifies the action type of the directive, which may take on values click, text or ignore. Each directive is list of String = [type, key, value]. Each key should be the Android resource name of a target UI element and each value should be the text input for that element. Values are only permitted for text type elements, so no value should be specified for click and ignore type elements.

### outputStyle
Output style of execution status. May be one of [`verbose`, `multi`, `single`].
For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.

`multi` displays separated status for each shard execution in separated line, lines are updated over time. Similar to gradle output when running multiple tasks in parallel. Requires ANSI codes support.

`single` displays shortened status of all executions in single line. Similar to gcloud output when running with sharding. Should work on any console.

Default value is single.

=== "Groovy"
    ``` groovy
    outputSyle = "single"
    ```
=== "Kotlin"
    ``` kotlin
    outputStyle.set("single")
    ```
