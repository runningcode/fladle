# Results

By default, results are placed in the `build/fladle/results/<matrix name>` directly.

A merged junit report is available in `JUnitReport.xml`

On failures only, an html report with links to failed shards is also generated in the results directory with the name `HtmlErrorReport.html`.

A cost report is also available `CostReport.txt`.
